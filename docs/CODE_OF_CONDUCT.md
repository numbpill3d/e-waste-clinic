# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

The E-Waste Reverse Engineering Clinic exists to teach people about electronics and build a community where hardware knowledge is shared freely. We want this to be a space where anyone can learn, ask questions, make mistakes, and grow their skills without fear of judgment or harassment.

This code of conduct exists to make sure everyone feels safe and welcome.

## Our Standards

### What We Encourage

- **Ask questions.** There are no stupid questions. If you do not understand something, ask. Someone else probably has the same question.

- **Make mistakes.** You will break things, misidentify chips, and write code that does not work. That is how learning happens. Share your mistakes so others can learn from them too.

- **Share what you learn.** If you figure something out, write it down. Add it to the documentation. Help the next person who has the same problem.

- **Be patient.** People learn at different speeds and come from different backgrounds. Take the time to explain things clearly.

- **Give credit.** If you use someone else's work or ideas, say so. Acknowledge contributions and thank people who help you.

### What We Do Not Tolerate

- **Harassment of any kind.** This includes offensive comments about gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, race, religion, or any other personal characteristic. It also includes unwelcome sexual attention, stalking, or intimidation.

- **Gatekeeping.** Do not tell people they are not ready, not qualified, or need to learn something else first. Everyone starts somewhere.

- **Elitism.** Do not belittle people for not knowing things, using beginner tools, or asking basic questions. You were a beginner once too.

- **Disruptive behavior.** Do not monopolize workshop time, talk over others, or prevent people from learning. If someone asks you to step back, step back.

- **Unsafe practices.** Follow safety guidelines when working with electronics and tools. Do not pressure others to skip safety steps.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- In-person workshops and events
- Online communication (email, chat, video calls)
- Any space where you are representing this project

## Enforcement

If someone violates this code of conduct:

1. **Talk to them directly if you feel safe doing so.** Sometimes people do not realize their behavior is a problem. A simple conversation can resolve many issues.

2. **Contact the project maintainers.** Email splicer@hiddenlayermedia.com with a description of what happened. Include dates, times, and any relevant context.

3. **Expect a response.** We will investigate all reports and respond within 7 days. We take this seriously.

### Possible Consequences

Depending on the severity and frequency of the violation, consequences may include:

- A private conversation to address the behavior
- A public warning
- Temporary ban from project spaces
- Permanent ban from project spaces

We will always try to handle things fairly and proportionally. Our goal is to maintain a safe community, not to punish people unnecessarily.

## Reporting

**Email:** splicer@hiddenlayermedia.com

Include as much detail as you can:

- What happened
- When and where it happened
- Who was involved
- Any witnesses or documentation
- How you would like us to respond

All reports will be kept confidential. We will not share your name or details without your permission unless legally required to do so.

## Attribution

This code of conduct is adapted from common open source community standards and emphasizes practical, enforceable behavior guidelines rather than aspirational language.

## Questions

If you are not sure whether something violates this code of conduct, ask. It is better to check than to assume.

If you see something that makes you uncomfortable but are not sure if it rises to the level of a violation, you can still reach out. We would rather know about potential problems than have people stay quiet.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to making this project welcoming to everyone. We will listen to concerns, take action when needed, and continuously work to make this a better community.

Hardware knowledge belongs to everyone. Let us keep it that way.
