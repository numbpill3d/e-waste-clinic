# Resources

This folder contains the reference materials, guides, and community tools that support the E-Waste Reverse Engineering Clinic. Everything here is organized to help participants learn, find what they need quickly, and contribute back to the project.

## What's Here

### datasheets/

A curated library of chip datasheets organized by chip family. This is your reference when you're trying to understand a component you've pulled from e-waste or are about to probe with GreatFET.

- Pinouts and signal descriptions
- Electrical specifications and timing diagrams
- Protocol details for I²C, SPI, and other buses
- Family reference guides for quick identification

**How to use:** When you find a chip marking, search here first to understand what you're looking at before you start probing.

### images/

Visual documentation from workshops, reference photos, and annotated hardware guides. These images help document what we're learning and make it easier for others to understand chip identification and setup procedures.

- Workshop photos and participant work
- High-resolution chip photography and markings
- GreatFET connection and probe placement guides
- Annotated circuit board images showing common patterns

**Why it matters:** A good photo tells a story that words can't. These images are part of how we teach and document the clinic.

### workshops/

Templates, formats, and materials for running your own workshop. Whether you're in Charlotte or starting a clinic in your own city, these resources help you organize and facilitate effective learning sessions.

- Workshop announcement templates
- Facilitator guides and activity plans
- Participant handouts and worksheets
- Logistics checklists and setup notes

**How to use:** Pick a format that works for your group, adapt it to your community, and run your own clinic. Then share what worked so we can all learn from it.

### charlotte_recycling_list.md

A practical guide to where you can source e-waste and where to responsibly dispose of materials in Charlotte. This file bridges the gap between learning and sustainability—it's about ethical sourcing and responsible handling.

- Local e-waste collection centers
- Donation and reuse options
- Places to find scrap circuit boards and components
- Responsible disposal for hazardous materials

**Why this matters:** Part of what makes this a real clinic is that we practice what we preach. We source ethically, learn deeply, and dispose responsibly.

### learning_links.md

External resources and references that support your learning journey. This isn't duplicating documentation elsewhere—it's pointing you to the best places to learn about hardware, protocols, tools, and the repair movement.

- GreatFET official documentation and examples
- Protocol references (I²C, SPI, USB)
- Electronics fundamentals and theory
- Right-to-repair and open hardware communities
- Other hardware reverse engineering projects

**How to use:** If you're stuck or want to go deeper on a topic, start here. These are vetted resources from real projects that inspired and shaped this clinic.

### troubleshooting-guide.md

Real solutions to real problems. As people work with GreatFET and probe chips, questions and issues come up. This guide collects what we've learned so you don't have to debug the same problem twice.

- GreatFET connection issues and driver problems
- Chip identification challenges
- Protocol communication troubleshooting
- Data logging and script errors
- Common mistakes and how to recover

**How to use:** Something not working? Check here first. And when you solve a problem, add it to the guide so the next person doesn't get stuck.

## How to Navigate This

- **New to hardware hacking?** Start with `learning_links.md` to build your foundation.
- **Have a chip to identify?** Look in `datasheets/` for the chip family and pinout.
- **Stuck on a problem?** Check `troubleshooting-guide.md` before you panic.
- **Want to run a workshop?** Browse `workshops/` for templates and ideas.
- **In Charlotte and need materials?** `charlotte_recycling_list.md` is your resource.
- **Want to see what others have done?** Check `images/` for documentation from past workshops.

## Contributing to Resources

This folder exists to serve the community. If you find something useful, document it well, or solve a problem creatively—contribute it back.

- Found a helpful datasheet? Add it to `datasheets/` with good organization.
- Discovered a troubleshooting tip? Update `troubleshooting-guide.md`.
- Ran a successful workshop? Share photos and materials in `workshops/` and `images/`.
- Know a great learning resource? Add it to `learning_links.md` with a brief description.
- Found a new e-waste source or disposal option in Charlotte? Update `charlotte_recycling_list.md`.

Pull requests are welcome. Keep everything organized, clearly labeled, and useful for the next person.

## No Gatekeeping

These resources aren't locked behind paywalls or membership. They're here because we believe hardware literacy should be accessible to everyone. Download them, use them in your own workshops, modify them for your community, and share them forward.

If something here helped you, help someone else. That's how this works.

## Questions or Feedback?

- Check the relevant guide or folder first
- Look through `troubleshooting-guide.md` for common issues
- Open an issue on the main repository if something isn't clear
- Reach out to the community—we're here to help
