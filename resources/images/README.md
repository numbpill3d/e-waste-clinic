# Resource Images

This directory contains visual resources for the E-Waste Reverse Engineering Clinic.

## Planned Images

### poster_chip_anatomy.png
Visual reference guide showing:
- Common chip package types (SOIC, TSSOP, QFN, DIP, etc.)
- How to read chip markings
- Pin numbering conventions
- Package size references

### workshop_photo_placeholder.jpg
Photos from actual workshop sessions showing:
- Participants probing circuit boards
- GreatFET setup and wiring examples
- Chip identification in progress
- Community learning environment

## Adding Images

When adding images to this directory:

1. Use descriptive filenames (lowercase, underscores)
2. Optimize file sizes (aim for under 500KB for photos)
3. Use PNG for diagrams, JPG for photos
4. Add alt text descriptions when referencing in documentation
5. Ensure images are your own or properly licensed

## Image Guidelines

- Take photos with good lighting
- Include scale references when showing chips
- Blur faces in workshop photos unless you have permission
- Credit any diagrams or illustrations you did not create
- Document what is shown in each image

## Placeholder Status

Currently, image files are placeholders. Real images will be added as the project develops and workshops are documented.
