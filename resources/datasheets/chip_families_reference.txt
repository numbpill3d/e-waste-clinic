========================================
IDENTIFICATION WORKFLOW
========================================

Step 1: Package Type
  Count the pins
  Identify package (SOIC, QFP, QFN, etc.)

Step 2: Location on Board
  Near processor → Memory, peripherals
  Near Ethernet jack → PHY chip
  Near power input → Voltage regulator
  Near USB port → USB controller

Step 3: Read Markings
  Manufacturer logo
  Part number (most important!)
  Date code

Step 4: Look Up
  Search part number online
  Check this list for common families
  Download datasheet

Step 5: Verify
  Pin count matches datasheet
  Package type matches
  Board context makes sense


========================================
MANUFACTURER LOGOS
========================================

⊗   Realtek
M   Microchip
ST  STMicroelectronics
TI  Texas Instruments (triangle/box)
AD  Analog Devices
∞   Broadcom
*   Marvell (sometimes stylized M)
▽   National Semiconductor (now TI)
◇   Infineon

If no logo: Search the part number!


========================================
DATING YOUR BOARD
========================================

Date codes tell you when the chip was made:

YYWW format (most common):
  2136 = Year 2021, Week 36 (September)
  1952 = Year 2019, Week 52 (December)

YWW format (older/asian):
  936 = Year 2009 (or 1999, or 2019...), Week 36
  
Lot codes:
  Usually letters + numbers
  Not useful for dating
  Used by manufacturer for tracking

Context clues:
  All chips have similar dates → manufactured together
  Wide range of dates → repair, rework, or upgrade


========================================
TIPS FOR WORKSHOPS
========================================

Start with easy chips:
1. Find a SOIC-8 chip (likely 24C EEPROM)
2. Look for voltage regulators (SOT-223)
3. Identify the main processor (largest QFP/QFN)
4. Find the Ethernet PHY (near RJ45)

Tools you need:
  - Magnifying glass or USB microscope
  - This reference sheet
  - Datasheet collection
  - Patience!

Common frustrations:
  - Markings worn off → Try different angles, lighting
  - Can't read small text → Use magnification, camera zoom
  - Part number not found → Try partial number, manufacturer
  - Too many similar chips → Note location, context

When stuck:
  - Ask for help
  - Take photos and research later
  - Document what you CAN see
  - Move to a different chip
