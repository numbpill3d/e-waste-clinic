0x78-0x7F    Reserved or specialty

========================================
TIPS FOR IDENTIFICATION
========================================

Multiple 0x50-0x57 devices:
  → Likely EEPROM chips with different address pins

Single 0x68 device:
  → Check board context
  → Near oscillator crystal = RTC
  → Near MCU on motion device = IMU

Addresses 0x76-0x77:
  → Environmental sensors
  → Usually BME280 or BMP series
  → Check for "BOSCH" marking on chip

No response at any address:
  → Check wiring (SDA, SCL, GND)
  → Verify board has power
  → Try slower I²C speed (--speed 100000)
  → Check for pull-up resistors (4.7K typical)

========================================
ADDRESS PIN CONFIGURATION
========================================

Many I²C chips have address selection pins.

Example: 24C256 EEPROM
  Base address: 0x50
  A0 pin: GND=0, VCC=1 (adds 0x01 to base)
  A1 pin: GND=0, VCC=1 (adds 0x02 to base)
  A2 pin: GND=0, VCC=1 (adds 0x04 to base)

  A2=0, A1=0, A0=0  →  0x50
  A2=0, A1=0, A0=1  →  0x51
  A2=0, A1=1, A0=0  →  0x52
  A2=0, A1=1, A0=1  →  0x53
  A2=1, A1=0, A0=0  →  0x54
  A2=1, A1=0, A0=1  →  0x55
  A2=1, A1=1, A0=0  →  0x56
  A2=1, A1=1, A0=1  →  0x57

Check the datasheet to find which pins are address pins!

========================================
WRITE VS READ ADDRESSES
========================================

Some documentation shows "write" and "read" addresses.

I²C uses 7-bit addresses, but transmitted as 8 bits:
  [7-bit address] + [R/W bit]

If you see addresses like 0xA0 and 0xA1:
  0xA0 = Write to device at 0x50 (0xA0 >> 1 = 0x50)
  0xA1 = Read from device at 0x50 (0xA1 >> 1 = 0x50)

Most modern tools (including GreatFET) use 7-bit addressing,
so you will see 0x50, not 0xA0/0xA1.

========================================
SCANNING TIPS
========================================

Full bus scan takes 30-60 seconds

If you know what you are looking for:
  EEPROM → Only scan 0x50-0x57
  RTC    → Only scan 0x68-0x69
  Sensor → Only scan 0x76-0x77

Speed options:
  Standard: 100 kHz (100000)
  Fast:     400 kHz (400000) - default
  High:     3.4 MHz (3400000) - rare

Use slower speeds if:
  - Long wires between device and GreatFET
  - Getting scan errors
  - Old/damaged boards

========================================
WHEN NOTHING SHOWS UP
========================================

Checklist:
[ ] GreatFET connected and recognized (greatfet_info)
[ ] SDA wire connected to correct pin
[ ] SCL wire connected to correct pin
[ ] GND connected between GreatFET and target board
[ ] Target board has power (check with multimeter)
[ ] I²C pull-up resistors present (4.7K on SDA and SCL)
[ ] No shorts between SDA, SCL, or GND
[ ] Tried slower speed (--speed 100000)

Some devices need:
  - Specific power-up sequence
  - Initialization commands
  - Reset pin held high/low
  - External oscillator running
