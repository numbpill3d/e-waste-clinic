========================================
PIN NUMBERING RULES
========================================

General Rule: Start at marking, count counter-clockwise

DIP / SOIC / TSSOP:
  - Pin 1 marked with dot or notch
  - Pin 1 is top-left (notch at top)
  - Count down left side, then up right side

QFP / QFN:
  - Pin 1 marked with dot on package corner
  - Count counter-clockwise around chip
  - Sometimes also has chamfered corner at pin 1

BGA:
  - Grid labeled A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.
  - Usually A1 is top-left
  - Check datasheet!


========================================
READING CHIP MARKINGS
========================================

Typical chip marking format:

    [LOGO]          ← Manufacturer logo
    STM32F103C8     ← Part number
    CHN 936         ← Country, date code
    ABCD1234        ← Batch/lot code

Date codes:
  YYWW = Year (2 digits) + Week
  936  = Year 09 or 19, Week 36
  2136 = Year 2021, Week 36

Common manufacturer logos:
  ST = STMicroelectronics
  TI = Texas Instruments
  AD = Analog Devices
  M  = Microchip
  ⊗  = Realtek (circle with cross)
  
If no logo, search the part number online.


========================================
PACKAGE SIZE COMPARISON
========================================

Smallest to largest (typical):

SOT-23 (3-6 pin)
  ↓ tiny transistors, small regulators
QFN-16
  ↓ modern compact chips
SOIC-8
  ↓ very common (memory, regulators)
TSSOP-20
  ↓ logic, interface chips
SOIC-16
  ↓ larger memory, interface
SSOP-28
  ↓ Ethernet PHY, USB controller
QFP-48
  ↓ small microcontroller
DIP-28
  ↓ old through-hole chips
QFP-100
  ↓ large microcontroller
BGA-256
  ↓ RAM, high-end processor


========================================
TIPS FOR IDENTIFICATION
========================================

Use magnification:
  - USB microscope (cheap, 20-40x)
  - Magnifying glass (5-10x)
  - Phone camera + zoom (surprisingly good)

Check these landmarks:
  - Pin 1 dot or notch
  - Pin count (count visible leads)
  - Package width (measure with calipers)
  - Any visible markings

Write everything down:
  - Even partial numbers help
  - Date codes can confirm age
  - Batch codes might be searchable

Take photos:
  - Focus on markings
  - Include ruler for scale
  - Multiple angles
  - Compare later if unsure


========================================
COMMON MISTAKES
========================================

Counting pins wrong:
  → Double-check by counting twice
  → Some packages have NC (no connect) pins

Confusing SOIC with TSSOP:
  → Measure the width (SOIC is wider)
  → TSSOP pins are much tighter

Assuming BGA is QFN:
  → Look for any visible pads (QFN has them)
  → BGAs are perfectly smooth underneath

Missing pin 1 indicator:
  → Sometimes worn off or unclear
  → Check datasheet for alternative markers


========================================
