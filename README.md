# E-Waste Reverse Engineering Clinic

A community project based in **Charlotte, North Carolina** that turns e-waste into a classroom. We collect discarded electronics, probe the boards with **GreatFET One**, and identify what each chip is and how it communicates. Every discovery is logged in a public database of salvaged components.

The purpose is simple: **to teach those who wish to learn**. Charlotte used to have a hackerspace, but it’s gone. This project aims to bring that energy back - hands-on, curious, and open.

## Goals

- Teach people how to identify and understand chips from real boards  
- Reduce e-waste by reclaiming usable components  
- Build a shared database of microcontrollers, sensors, and peripherals  
- Rebuild a hardware hacking community in Charlotte  

## What We’re Doing

We hold small community “clinics” where anyone can bring in a broken device or scrap board. Volunteers -ideally- use the **GreatFET One** to:

- Scan I²C devices and identify their addresses  
- Enumerate USB chips and read descriptors  
- Probe UART or SPI lines for serial data  
- Log each result into a shared spreadsheet  

Over time, this forms a searchable map of what’s inside the tech we throw away.

## Why GreatFET

The GreatFET is open, transparent, and friendly to beginners. It bridges the gap between curiosity and understanding. With it, anyone can safely connect to a board and *see* what’s really there.

## How to Contribute

- Fork this repo and document your own teardown sessions.  
- Add new GreatFET scripts or fix existing ones.  
- Submit chip data to expand the shared catalog.  
- Share the project with teachers, repair cafés, or hackerspaces.
